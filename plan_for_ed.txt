1. ed only allows 1024 characters per line TOTAL

2. ed allows infinite lines in a file.

3. By default, the contents of a file are stored in

a linked list of linked lists, where each linked list

stores the letter contents of a line.

4. When searching, an AVL algorithm is used  to convert:

the linked list of linked lists into one large binary tree of

words.

5. A single space is ignored, but all spaces afterwards are

considered part of a word up to the next nonspace character.

6. This makes searching for a word in the text file much, much faster.

Each root of the binary tree contains a pointer to the head of the linked

list and an int storing the line number the word is in.

7. A hash table algorithm will be used to convert the line number to the exact memory

address of the head of the linked list that stores the contents of that line.

8. The AVL binary tree will be used whenever ed is supposed to find a string using g/re/p and s/re/p

9. It is best to update the AVL binary tree for each line added. Although the cost of this memory.
